# HaLOS Imported Containers - Architecture

**Version**: 1.0
**Status**: Active
**Last Updated**: 2024-11-30

## Overview

The HaLOS Imported Containers repository implements a multi-source architecture for automatically converting and packaging container applications from various upstream app stores. This document describes the system architecture, component relationships, technology stack, and deployment strategy.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Architecture

The system consists of four major layers:

1. **Source Management Layer**: Handles upstream repository monitoring, sync configuration, and change detection
2. **Conversion Layer**: Transforms upstream app definitions to HaLOS package format using container-packaging-tools
3. **Build Layer**: Generates Debian packages for apps and store definitions
4. **Distribution Layer**: Publishes packages to APT repository and manages releases

Each layer operates independently, allowing for parallel processing of multiple sources and incremental updates.

### Multi-Source Design

The architecture supports unlimited upstream sources through a source-grouped directory structure. Each source is self-contained with its own:

- **Apps directory**: Converted application definitions
- **Store package**: Debian package defining the Cockpit UI store
- **Upstream configuration**: Sync settings and source metadata
- **Independent versioning**: Store packages evolve separately from app packages

This design enables:
- Adding new sources without modifying existing ones
- Per-source build and deployment
- Independent sync schedules
- Source-specific quality standards
- Clear attribution in package names and UI

### Component Relationships

**Upstream Sources** provide app definitions in their native formats (CasaOS JSON, Runtipi compose, etc.). The **Sync System** monitors these sources for changes and creates pull requests when updates are detected.

**Converters** (part of container-packaging-tools) transform upstream formats to the HaLOS standard format (metadata.yaml, config.yml, docker-compose.yml). Each source type has a dedicated converter that understands its specific format.

**Build System** processes converted apps and store definitions to create Debian packages. The build process is source-aware, applying correct naming prefixes and dependencies.

**APT Repository** (apt.hatlabs.fi) receives packages through the CI/CD pipeline, making them available for installation on HaLOS systems via standard APT mechanisms.

**Cockpit UI** discovers stores through installed store packages and filters apps based on package name patterns defined in each store's configuration.

## Directory Structure

### Root Level Organization

The repository uses a source-grouped structure at the root level:

- **sources/** - Contains all upstream source integrations, each in its own subdirectory
- **tools/** - Build automation scripts and validation utilities
- **docs/** - Specifications, architecture, and guides
- **.github/** - CI/CD workflows and GitHub configuration

### Source Directory Structure

Each source directory follows a standard template:

- **apps/** - Contains converted application definitions, one subdirectory per app
- **store/** - Store definition YAML and Debian packaging files for the store package
- **upstream/** - Sync configuration and metadata about the upstream source
- **README.md** - Source-specific documentation

### App Directory Structure

Each app within a source's apps/ directory contains:

- **metadata.yaml** - Package metadata (name, description, version, license, maintainer)
- **config.yml** - User-configurable parameters schema (environment variables, volumes, ports)
- **docker-compose.yml** - Container service definition
- **debian/** - Debian packaging files (control, rules, install, changelog)

### Template Directory

The **sources/_template/** directory provides a skeleton for adding new sources:

- **apps/.gitkeep** - Placeholder for apps directory
- **store/template.yaml** - Example store configuration
- **upstream/source.yaml.example** - Template sync configuration
- **README.md.template** - Documentation template with placeholders

## Data Models and Schemas

### Package Metadata Schema

Package metadata follows the HaLOS container package standard defined in container-packaging-tools. Key elements:

- **Package name**: Source-prefixed, lowercase (e.g., casaos-uptimekuma-container)
- **Version**: Tracks upstream app version
- **Description**: Synopsis (80 char limit) and long description
- **Origin**: Always "Hat Labs" for imported packages
- **Source attribution**: Metadata indicates which upstream source the app came from
- **Dependencies**: Declares docker.io and any other required packages
- **Architecture**: Typically "all" (container images handle architecture)

### Configuration Schema

Configuration schemas define user-customizable parameters:

- **Environment variables**: Key-value pairs with types, defaults, and descriptions
- **Volumes**: Mount points with host paths and container paths
- **Ports**: Published ports with host/container port mapping
- **Groups**: Logical grouping of related configuration options
- **Validation**: Type checking, required fields, allowed values

### Store Definition Schema

Store packages define how apps appear in Cockpit UI:

- **Store ID**: Unique identifier for the store
- **Display name**: User-visible store name
- **Description**: Markdown-formatted store description
- **Icon and banner**: Visual assets for store branding
- **Package filters**: Patterns to include packages in this store (e.g., casaos-*-container)
- **Origin filters**: Filter by package origin (Hat Labs)
- **Display options**: Sorting, screenshot display, categories

### Upstream Source Schema

Upstream source configuration defines sync behavior:

- **Source type**: GitHub, GitLab, HTTP, or other
- **Repository URL**: Location of upstream app store
- **Path within repo**: Directory containing app definitions
- **Branch**: Which branch to track
- **Converter type**: Which converter to use (casaos, runtipi, custom)
- **Sync schedule**: How often to check for updates
- **Conversion options**: Converter-specific settings

## Technology Stack

### Core Technologies

- **Git and GitHub**: Version control and collaboration platform. GitHub Actions provides CI/CD execution.
- **Debian Packaging**: Standard .deb package format for distribution. Uses dpkg-buildpackage, debhelper, and dh-python.
- **Python 3.11+**: Runtime for container-packaging-tools and build scripts. Uses uv for dependency management.
- **Docker**: Required at runtime for container execution. Not used in build process.
- **APT Repository**: Custom repository at apt.hatlabs.fi for package distribution.

### Build Tools

- **container-packaging-tools**: Python package providing converters for different upstream formats. Installed via uv from GitHub repository.
- **dpkg-buildpackage**: Standard Debian package builder. Generates .deb, .buildinfo, and .changes files.
- **bash**: Shell scripts for build automation and validation.

### CI/CD Infrastructure

- **GitHub Actions**: Runs workflows for PR validation, main branch builds, and releases.
- **Repository-Specific Workflows**: Per-source workflow files implementing build and publishing logic inline.
- **APT Repository Integration**: Automated package upload using APT_REPO_PAT secret for authentication via repository_dispatch.

### Technology Decisions and Rationale

- **Why source-grouped structure**: Enables independent evolution of sources without conflicts. New sources can be added without touching existing code.
- **Why Debian packages**: Standard distribution format for Debian-based systems. Integrates with APT dependency resolution and version management.
- **Why per-source stores**: Provides clear attribution in UI. Users can choose which sources to install and trust.
- **Why container-packaging-tools**: Proven converter with 100% success rate for CasaOS. Extensible to new formats through plugin system.
- **Why GitHub Actions**: Native integration with GitHub repositories. Per-source workflows provide isolation and clarity.

## Integration Points

### Upstream Integration

The system integrates with upstream app stores through:

- **Git repository monitoring**: Daily checks for changes using GitHub Actions scheduled workflows
- **Format-specific converters**: Transform upstream app definitions to HaLOS format
- **Change detection**: Compare current apps with upstream to identify new/updated/removed apps
- **Pull request creation**: Automated PRs when upstream changes are detected

### Container Packaging Tools Integration

Integration with container-packaging-tools provides:

- **Batch conversion**: Convert all apps from a source in a single operation
- **Validation**: Schema validation during conversion ensures quality
- **Metadata generation**: Automatic generation of Debian control files
- **Fallback handling**: Intelligent defaults for missing or invalid upstream data

### APT Repository Integration

Packages are published through:

- **Unstable channel**: Automatic on merge to main branch via repository_dispatch
- **Stable channel**: Manual via GitHub release creation and repository_dispatch
- **Repository structure**: Organized by distribution (trixie) and component (main)
- **Authentication**: GitHub PAT (APT_REPO_PAT) with write access to apt.hatlabs.fi repository

### Cockpit UI Integration

Store packages integrate with Cockpit through:

- **Package installation**: Installing a store package makes it visible in Cockpit
- **Store configuration files**: Installed to /usr/share/container-stores/
- **Package filtering**: Cockpit filters packages based on store configuration
- **Multi-store support**: Multiple stores coexist and appear separately in UI

## Build Process

### Build Workflow

The build process operates in these phases:

- **Phase 1 - Validation**: Validate directory structure and all app definitions against schemas
- **Phase 2 - Per-Source Building**: For each source in sources/:
  - Build store package using Debian packaging in store/debian/
  - For each app in apps/, generate Debian package with container-packaging-tools
  - Apply source-specific naming prefix
  - Collect all .deb, .buildinfo, and .changes files
- **Phase 3 - Aggregation**: Collect all packages from all sources into build/ directory
- **Phase 4 - Verification**: Ensure all expected packages were created successfully
- **Phase 5 - Publishing**: Upload packages to APT repository using shared workflows

### Package Naming Convention

All packages follow strict naming conventions:

- **App packages**: {source}-{appname}-container (e.g., casaos-uptimekuma-container)
- **Store packages**: {source}-container-store (e.g., casaos-container-store)
- **All lowercase**: Debian package names must be lowercase
- **Hyphens only**: No underscores or other special characters

### Build Modes

The build system supports multiple modes:

- **Full build**: Build all sources and all apps (default for main branch)
- **Source build**: Build only a specific source
- **Incremental build**: Build only changed apps (planned for future optimization)

### Build Scripts

- **tools/build-all.sh**: Iterates through all non-template sources and builds each one. Creates build/ directory and collects all packages.
- **tools/build-source.sh**: Builds a single source. Takes source name as argument. Builds store package first, then all app packages.
- **tools/validate-structure.sh**: Validates repository structure before building. Ensures all required directories exist and contain expected files.

## Version Management

### Repository Version

The VERSION file at repository root tracks infrastructure version:

- Incremented when directory structure changes
- Incremented when build process changes
- Incremented when adding new sources
- NOT incremented for app updates or store package updates

Used for git tags: v{version}+{N}_pre (unstable) and v{version}+{N} (stable)

### Store Package Versions

Each store package has independent versioning in its debian/changelog:

- Incremented when store configuration changes
- Incremented when store metadata (icon, banner, description) changes
- Follows Debian versioning: {upstream}+{revision} or {upstream}-{debian}

### App Package Versions

App packages track upstream versions:

- Version comes from upstream app definition
- Debian revision may be added for packaging fixes
- Different sources may have different versions of the same app

### Release Management

- **Unstable releases**: Automatic on every merge to main. Packages uploaded to unstable component.
- **Stable releases**: Manual via GitHub release creation. Packages promoted from unstable or rebuilt for stable component.
- **Tag format**: Git tags use unified versioning format with +N revision suffix.

## CI/CD Architecture

### Workflow Organization

The repository uses per-source workflows for build isolation. Each source has its own set of workflows, allowing independent building, failure isolation, and easier debugging.

**Architecture Pattern**: Repository-specific build, shared publish
- Per-source workflows handle source-specific build logic
- Shared workflows handle standardized publishing/releasing
- Build artifacts passed between jobs via GitHub Actions artifacts

**Per-Source Workflows**:

- **PR Workflow (.github/workflows/pr-{source}.yml)**: Runs on pull requests affecting this source
  - Validates directory structure for this source
  - Validates all app definitions in this source
  - Calls repository build action: `.github/actions/build-deb` with `source: {source}`
  - Builds packages for this source only (but doesn't publish)
  - Reports status to PR

- **Main Workflow (.github/workflows/main-{source}.yml)**: Runs on merge to main when this source changes
  - Calls repository build action to build packages for this source
  - Uploads build artifacts (all .deb, .buildinfo, .changes files)
  - Calls shared workflow for publishing to unstable channel
  - Source failures don't block other sources

- **Release Workflow (.github/workflows/release-{source}.yml)**: Runs on release publication
  - Calls repository build action to build packages for stable
  - Uploads build artifacts
  - Calls shared workflow for publishing to stable component
  - Creates source-specific release artifacts

- **Sync Workflow (.github/workflows/sync-{source}.yml)**: NOT YET IMPLEMENTED
  - Will schedule daily checks per source for upstream changes
  - Will create PRs when changes detected
  - Will run converter on modified apps

**Benefits of Per-Source Workflows**:

- **Isolation**: One source's build failure doesn't affect others
- **Debugging**: Clear which source is failing, build logic is explicit
- **Parallelism**: All sources build concurrently
- **Selective builds**: Can rebuild just one source
- **Path filtering**: Workflows only trigger on relevant file changes
- **Flexibility**: Source-specific build requirements easily accommodated

### Publishing Strategy

**Current Implementation**: Repository workflows handle publishing inline (NOT using shared workflows)

The main-casaos.yml workflow:
- Builds packages using repository-specific actions
- Creates pre-release directly via GitHub API
- Triggers repository_dispatch to apt.hatlabs.fi for package publishing
- Includes all publishing logic inline for transparency and debugging

The release-casaos.yml workflow:
- Builds packages for stable release
- Creates GitHub release directly
- Triggers repository_dispatch to apt.hatlabs.fi for stable channel publishing

**Benefits of Inline Publishing**:
- Complete control over publishing process
- Easy debugging (all logic visible in workflow file)
- No dependency on external shared workflows
- Source-specific customization when needed

### GitHub Actions Structure

**Workflows (.github/workflows/)**: Per-source workflow files
- pr-casaos.yml: PR validation for CasaOS source
- main-casaos.yml: Main branch build for CasaOS source
- release-casaos.yml: Release build for CasaOS source
- sync-casaos.yml: Upstream sync for CasaOS source
- (Repeat pattern for each source: runtipi, casaos-community, etc.)

**Actions (.github/actions/)**: Repository-specific reusable actions

- **build-deb/action.yml**: Build Debian packages for a specific source
  - Input: `source` (required) - Source name (e.g., "casaos")
  - Runs: `./tools/build-source.sh ${{ inputs.source }}`
  - Outputs: All .deb, .buildinfo, .changes files in build/ directory
  - Used by all per-source workflows

- **validate-source/action.yml**: Validate source structure and app definitions
  - Input: `source` (required) - Source name to validate
  - Runs: `./tools/validate-structure.sh ${{ inputs.source }}`
  - Fails if validation errors found

**Build Tools (tools/)**: Source-aware build scripts
- build-source.sh: Build a single source (called by build-deb action)
- build-all.sh: Build all sources (for testing)
- validate-structure.sh: Validate a source's structure

**Path Filtering**: Each workflow uses GitHub Actions path filtering to trigger only on changes to its source:
- pr-casaos.yml triggers on: sources/casaos/**
- main-casaos.yml triggers on: sources/casaos/**
- Common files (tools/, docs/) trigger all source workflows

### Secrets and Configuration

**APT_REPO_PAT**: GitHub personal access token with write access to apt.hatlabs.fi repository (shared across all source workflows)

**Per-Source Workflow Configuration**:
- apt-distro: trixie (Debian 13)
- apt-component: main
- package-name: {source}-container-store (e.g., casaos-container-store)
- source-dir: sources/{source}/ (path to build)

**Shared Configuration**:
- All sources publish to the same APT repository
- All sources use unified versioning scheme
- Common tooling scripts available to all workflows

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment

Developers work in this workflow:

- **Local repository**: Clone halos-imported-containers
- **Container-packaging-tools**: Install via uv for local conversion testing
- **Build locally**: Run tools/build-source.sh to test builds
- **Create PR**: Push branch and create PR for review
- **CI validates**: GitHub Actions runs full validation
- **Merge**: After PR approval, merge to main triggers unstable release

### Unstable Channel

The unstable channel provides continuous deployment:

- **Trigger**: Every merge to main branch
- **Build**: All packages rebuilt
- **Publishing**: Uploaded to trixie/main component with _pre suffix
- **Availability**: Immediately available for testing on HaLOS systems
- **Purpose**: Rapid iteration and testing

### Stable Channel

The stable channel provides vetted releases:

- **Trigger**: Manual GitHub release creation
- **Build**: Packages built for stable (or promoted from unstable)
- **Publishing**: Uploaded to trixie/main component without _pre suffix
- **Availability**: Available for production HaLOS systems
- **Purpose**: Production-ready, tested releases

### Multi-Stage Deployment

The deployment follows this progression:

- **Stage 1 - Development**: Local builds and testing
- **Stage 2 - PR**: Validation in CI, review by maintainers
- **Stage 3 - Unstable**: Deployed to unstable channel for testing
- **Stage 4 - Validation**: Testing on HaLOS systems
- **Stage 5 - Stable**: Release creation publishes to stable channel

## Security Considerations

### Package Verification

All packages include:

- **Source attribution**: Metadata clearly indicates upstream source
- **Upstream URL**: Link back to original upstream definition
- **License information**: Recorded from upstream metadata
- **Maintainer**: Hat Labs as package maintainer
- **Signature**: APT repository signing (handled by apt.hatlabs.fi)

### Upstream Trust

The system does not:

- Validate upstream container images (trust upstream source)
- Scan for vulnerabilities (rely on upstream scanning)
- Modify container images (only package metadata)

Users should:

- Understand which sources they trust
- Install only store packages from trusted sources
- Review app descriptions and permissions before installing

### Build Security

Build process runs in:

- **Isolated GitHub Actions runners**: Fresh environment for each build
- **No network access during build**: Builds use only repository contents
- **Secrets properly scoped**: APT_REPO_PAT has minimal required permissions
- **Reproducible builds**: Same input produces same output

### Repository Access Control

- **Main branch protection**: Requires pull request reviews
- **Branch protection rules**: Enforce checks passing before merge
- **Write access**: Limited to maintainers
- **PAT rotation**: APT_REPO_PAT should be rotated periodically

## Scalability Considerations

### Handling Growth

The architecture scales to support:

- **Many sources**: Source-grouped structure isolates sources
- **Many apps per source**: Parallel build of apps within a source
- **Frequent updates**: Incremental conversion of changed apps only
- **Large packages**: Build artifacts collected efficiently

### Performance Optimizations

Current optimizations:

- **Per-source workflows**: Sources build in parallel automatically via separate GitHub Actions workflows
- **Path filtering**: Workflows only trigger on relevant source changes
- **Shared workflows**: Reduce CI/CD execution time through caching
- **Validation early**: Catch errors before expensive builds
- **Build isolation**: Failed source builds don't block other sources

Future optimizations:

- **Incremental sync**: Only process changed apps (planned)
- **Cached conversions**: Skip conversion if upstream unchanged
- **Incremental package builds**: Build only changed apps within a source
- **Matrix parallelism**: Use matrix strategy to build multiple apps within a source concurrently

### Resource Management

Build resource usage:

- **GitHub Actions minutes**: ~5-10 minutes per source build, runs in parallel across sources
- **Selective triggering**: Path filtering means only changed sources consume CI minutes
- **Storage**: Build artifacts cleaned after upload
- **APT repository size**: Grows with number of packages (managed by apt.hatlabs.fi)
- **Network**: Minimal during build, higher during upstream sync
- **Parallel efficiency**: Multiple sources building simultaneously doesn't increase wall-clock time

## Extension Points

### Adding New Sources

To add a new source:

- **Step 1**: Copy sources/_template/ to sources/{newsource}/
- **Step 2**: Configure upstream/source.yaml with source details
- **Step 3**: Create store/{newsource}.yaml with store definition
- **Step 4**: Create debian packaging in store/debian/
- **Step 5**: Create workflow files in .github/workflows/:
  - pr-{newsource}.yml (copy and adapt from existing source)
  - main-{newsource}.yml (copy and adapt from existing source)
  - release-{newsource}.yml (copy and adapt from existing source)
  - sync-{newsource}.yml (copy and adapt from existing source)
- **Step 6**: Run converter to populate apps/
- **Step 7**: Test build with tools/build-source.sh {newsource}
- **Step 8**: Create PR with new source and workflows

The template system and per-source workflows ensure consistency, isolation, and easy debugging.

### Adding New Converters

Container-packaging-tools supports:

- **Built-in converters**: CasaOS, Runtipi (future)
- **Custom converters**: Plugin system for new formats
- **Converter options**: Per-source configuration in upstream/source.yaml

New converters should:

- Follow container-packaging-tools plugin API
- Handle missing/invalid data gracefully
- Generate complete metadata.yaml, config.yml, docker-compose.yml
- Support batch conversion mode

### Custom Build Steps

Build process can be extended:

- **Pre-build hooks**: Validation, linting, formatting
- **Post-build hooks**: Testing, verification, notifications
- **Per-source hooks**: Source-specific build customizations
- **Integration tests**: Validate packages install correctly

## Maintenance and Operations

### Daily Operations

Automated daily tasks:

- **Upstream sync**: Check all sources for changes (when implemented)
- **Build on merge**: Automatic build and publish to unstable
- **Dependency updates**: Dependabot for GitHub Actions and Python deps

Manual operations:

- **PR review and merge**: Review automated PRs from sync
- **Release creation**: Create GitHub release for stable channel
- **Source addition**: Add new sources as needed

### Monitoring

Monitor these indicators:

- **Conversion success rate**: Should remain 100% for valid apps
- **Build success rate**: Should be >95%
- **Sync latency**: Changes should appear within 24 hours
- **CI/CD failures**: Investigate and fix promptly

### Troubleshooting

Common issues and resolution:

- **Conversion failure**: Check upstream format changes, update converter
- **Build failure**: Validate package metadata, check dependencies
- **Sync failure**: Check upstream repository access, network issues
- **Publication failure**: Verify APT_REPO_PAT is valid

## Future Architecture Evolution

### Planned Enhancements

- **Automated upstream sync**: Daily scheduled workflow to check sources
- **Incremental builds**: Build only changed apps to reduce CI time
- **Parallel source builds**: Use GitHub Actions matrix for parallelism
- **Template improvements**: More comprehensive source templates

### Potential Changes

- **Alternative package formats**: Flatpak, Snap (if requested)
- **Multi-repository support**: Publish to multiple APT repositories
- **Metadata enhancement**: Richer app metadata, screenshots, ratings
- **Search integration**: Cross-source app search capability

### Backward Compatibility

Architecture changes must:

- **Maintain package names**: Existing packages continue to work
- **Support existing stores**: Store packages remain compatible
- **Preserve data**: User configurations and app data unaffected
- **Document migrations**: Clear upgrade path for breaking changes

## Conclusion

This architecture provides a scalable, maintainable foundation for importing container applications from multiple upstream sources into the HaLOS ecosystem. The source-grouped design enables independent evolution of sources while maintaining consistency through shared tooling and workflows.

Key architectural strengths:

- **Scalability**: Supports unlimited sources and apps
- **Maintainability**: Source isolation and template system
- **Automation**: Minimal manual intervention required
- **Extensibility**: Clear extension points for new sources and converters
- **Quality**: Validation at every step ensures package quality

The architecture follows HaLOS patterns established in halos-marine-containers while extending them for multi-source scenarios. This consistency simplifies maintenance and enables reuse of tooling across projects.

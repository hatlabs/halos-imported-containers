## Overview

Each source in this repository represents an upstream container app store (like CasaOS, Runtipi, etc.). Adding a new source involves:

1. Creating the source directory structure
2. Configuring upstream sync settings
3. Creating the store definition
4. Setting up Debian packaging
5. Creating CI/CD workflows
6. Running the converter to populate apps
7. Testing and validation

**Time Estimate**: 2-4 hours for a new source with existing converter support

**Note**: This guide uses generic examples (like `newsource`, `runtipi`) as placeholders. For actual working implementations, refer to `sources/casaos-official/` as the reference.

## Prerequisites

### Required Knowledge

- Basic understanding of Debian packaging
- Familiarity with YAML configuration files
- Understanding of GitHub Actions workflows
- Knowledge of the upstream source format you're converting

### Required Tools

- Git and GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- Docker and Docker Compose (for builds)
- Text editor
- Access to the halos-imported-containers repository

### Converter Availability

Before adding a source, verify that `container-packaging-tools` supports the upstream format:

**Currently Supported:**
- **CasaOS**: CasaOS App Store v2.0 format

**Custom Converters:**
If your upstream format isn't supported, you'll need to implement a converter in the [container-packaging-tools](https://github.com/hatlabs/container-packaging-tools) repository first. See the CasaOS converter as a reference implementation.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Copy Template Directory

Start by copying the template to create your new source:

```bash
# Navigate to repository root
cd halos-imported-containers

# Copy template (replace 'newsource' with your source name)
# Use lowercase, hyphens only (e.g., 'runtipi', 'casaos-community')
cp -r sources/_template sources/newsource

# Example: Adding Runtipi
cp -r sources/_template sources/runtipi
```

**Naming Convention:**
- Use lowercase letters only
- Use hyphens for word separation (not underscores)
- Make it descriptive but concise
- Examples: `casaos-official`, `runtipi`, `casaos-community`

### Step 2: Configure Upstream Source

Edit `sources/newsource/upstream/source.yaml`:

```bash
# Remove the .example extension
mv sources/newsource/upstream/source.yaml.example sources/newsource/upstream/source.yaml

# Edit the configuration
vim sources/newsource/upstream/source.yaml
```

**Key fields to configure** (example values - replace with your actual source):

```yaml
# Source identification (must match directory name)
source_id: newsource  # MUST match your directory name
source_name: "New Source"  # Display name
source_description: "Description of your source"

# Upstream repository (configure based on your upstream)
upstream:
  type: github  # github, gitlab, http, or git
  repository: "owner/repo"  # For GitHub: owner/repo format
  branch: "main"  # Branch to track
  path: "apps"  # Path to apps within repo (blank if root)

# Converter settings (must use implemented converter)
converter:
  type: casaos  # Currently only 'casaos' is implemented
  version: "2.0"  # CasaOS manifest version
  options:
    package_prefix: newsource  # Used in package names
    use_fallbacks: true
    validation_mode: "warn"

# Package defaults (standard for all sources)
defaults:
  origin: "Hat Labs"
  maintainer: "Hat Labs <info@hatlabs.fi>"
  section: "admin"
  priority: "optional"
```

**Important**: Currently only the `casaos` converter is implemented. You must either use CasaOS-compatible upstream data or implement a custom converter first.

See the [template file](../sources/_template/upstream/source.yaml.example) for detailed field descriptions.

### Step 3: Create Store Definition

Edit `sources/newsource/store/newsource.yaml`:

```bash
# Copy template and rename
cp sources/newsource/store/template.yaml sources/newsource/store/runtipi.yaml

# Edit store configuration
vim sources/newsource/store/runtipi.yaml
```

**Key configuration:**

```yaml
# Store identification (must match directory name)
id: runtipi

# Display name in Cockpit UI
name: Runtipi

# Markdown description
description: |
  Applications from the Runtipi community app store.

  Runtipi provides a curated collection of self-hosted applications
  with easy installation and management.

# Icon path (will be installed to this location)
icon: /usr/share/container-stores/runtipi/icon.svg

# Package filters
filters:
  include_origins:
    - "Hat Labs"
  include_patterns:
    - "runtipi-*-container"  # Must match your package_prefix

# Category definitions
category_metadata:
  - id: media
    label: Media & Entertainment
    icon: PlayCircleIcon
    description: Media servers and streaming applications

  # Add more categories based on your source's app types
```

**Important:** The `include_patterns` must match the `package_prefix` you set in `upstream/source.yaml`.

### Step 4: Add Store Branding (Optional)

Add an icon for your store:

```bash
# Add SVG icon (256x256 recommended)
cp /path/to/icon.svg sources/newsource/store/icon.svg

# Optional: Add banner image
cp /path/to/banner.svg sources/newsource/store/banner.svg
```

### Step 5: Configure Debian Packaging

Create Debian packaging files for the store package:

```bash
# Create debian directory
mkdir -p sources/newsource/store/debian
```

#### 5.1: Create `control` file

Create `sources/newsource/store/debian/control`:

```debian
Source: runtipi-container-store
Section: admin
Priority: optional
Maintainer: Hat Labs <info@hatlabs.fi>
Build-Depends: debhelper-compat (= 13)
Standards-Version: 4.6.2

Package: runtipi-container-store
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}
Description: Runtipi container application store
 Container application store definition for Runtipi apps.
 .
 This package provides the store configuration that enables
 Runtipi applications to appear in the HaLOS Cockpit container
 management interface.
```

#### 5.2: Create `rules` file

Create `sources/newsource/store/debian/rules`:

```makefile
#!/usr/bin/make -f

%:
	dh $@

override_dh_auto_install:
	# Install store definition
	install -D -m 0644 runtipi.yaml debian/runtipi-container-store/usr/share/container-stores/runtipi.yaml

	# Install icon
	install -D -m 0644 icon.svg debian/runtipi-container-store/usr/share/container-stores/runtipi/icon.svg

# Skip these steps for store packages (no binaries)
override_dh_auto_build:
override_dh_auto_test:
override_dh_strip:
override_dh_shlibdeps:
```

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x sources/newsource/store/debian/rules
```

#### 5.3: Create `changelog` file

Create `sources/newsource/store/debian/changelog`:

```
runtipi-container-store (0.1.0) trixie; urgency=medium

  * Initial release
  * Add Runtipi store definition
  * Configure package filters for runtipi-*-container packages

 -- Hat Labs <info@hatlabs.fi>  Fri, 29 Nov 2024 12:00:00 +0000
```

#### 5.4: Create `copyright` file

Create `sources/newsource/store/debian/copyright`:

```
Format: https://www.debian.org/doc/packaging-manuals/copyright-format/1.0/
Upstream-Name: runtipi-container-store
Source: https://github.com/hatlabs/halos-imported-containers

### Step 6: Create GitHub Workflows

Create three workflow files in `.github/workflows/`:

#### 6.1: PR Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/pr-runtipi.yml`:

```yaml
name: PR - Runtipi

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - 'sources/runtipi/**'
      - 'tools/**'
      - '.github/actions/**'
      - '.github/workflows/**runtipi.yml'

permissions:
  contents: read
  pull-requests: write

jobs:
  validate:
    name: Validate Runtipi
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Validate source structure
        uses: ./.github/actions/validate-source
        with:
          source: runtipi

  build:
    name: Build Runtipi Packages
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: validate
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build packages
        id: build
        uses: ./.github/actions/build-deb
        with:
          source: runtipi

      - name: Comment on PR with build results
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        if: always()
        with:
          script: |
            const buildOutcome = '${{ steps.build.outcome }}';
            const packageCount = '${{ steps.build.outputs.package-count }}' || '0';

            let body;
            if (buildOutcome === 'success') {
              body = `✅ **Build successful** for runtipi\n\n📦 Built ${packageCount} packages\n\nPackages are available as workflow artifacts for inspection.`;
            } else {
              body = `❌ **Build failed** for runtipi\n\nPlease check the workflow logs for details.`;
            }

            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: body
            });
```

#### 6.2: Main Branch Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/main-runtipi.yml`:

```yaml
name: Main - Runtipi

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
    paths:
      - 'sources/runtipi/**'
      - 'tools/**'
      - '.github/actions/**'
      - '.github/workflows/main-runtipi.yml'

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build Runtipi Packages
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      has-packages: ${{ steps.check-packages.outputs.has-packages }}
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build packages
        id: build
        uses: ./.github/actions/build-deb
        with:
          source: runtipi

      - name: Check if packages were built
        id: check-packages
        run: |
          if compgen -G "build/*.deb" > /dev/null; then
            echo "has-packages=true" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            echo "::notice::Found packages to upload"
          else
            echo "has-packages=false" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
            echo "::notice::No packages built (source not yet implemented)"
          fi

      - name: Upload build artifacts
        if: steps.check-packages.outputs.has-packages == 'true'
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: packages-runtipi-unstable
          path: |
            build/*.deb
            build/*.buildinfo
            build/*.changes
          retention-days: 30

  publish-unstable:
    name: Publish to Unstable Channel
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    if: needs.build.outputs.has-packages == 'true'
    steps:
      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: packages-runtipi-unstable
          path: build

      - name: List packages to publish
        run: |
          echo "::notice::Publishing to unstable channel"
          echo "::notice::Packages to publish:"
          ls -lh build/*.deb

      - name: Dispatch to APT repository
        uses: peter-evans/repository-dispatch@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.APT_REPO_PAT }}
          repository: hatlabs/apt.hatlabs.fi
          event-type: package-updated
          client-payload: |
            {
              "repository": "${{ github.repository }}",
              "distro": "trixie",
              "channel": "unstable",
              "component": "main"
            }

      - name: Report success
        run: |
          echo "=== Unstable Channel Publish Complete ==="
          echo "Repository: ${{ github.repository }}"
          echo "Distro: trixie"
          echo "Channel: unstable"
          echo "Component: main"
```

#### 6.3: Release Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/release-runtipi.yml`:

```yaml
name: Release - Runtipi

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

permissions:
  contents: read

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build Runtipi Packages
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build packages
        uses: ./.github/actions/build-deb
        with:
          source: runtipi

      - name: Upload build artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: packages-runtipi-stable
          path: |
            build/*.deb
            build/*.buildinfo
            build/*.changes

  publish-stable:
    name: Publish to Stable Channel
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - name: Download build artifacts
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: packages-runtipi-stable
          path: build

      - name: Dispatch to APT repository
        uses: peter-evans/repository-dispatch@v3
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.APT_REPO_PAT }}
          repository: hatlabs/apt.hatlabs.fi
          event-type: package-updated
          client-payload: |
            {
              "repository": "${{ github.repository }}",
              "distro": "trixie",
              "channel": "stable",
              "component": "main"
            }
```

### Step 7: Create Source README

Edit `sources/newsource/README.md`:

```bash
# Copy and customize template
cp sources/_template/README.md.template sources/newsource/README.md

# Edit and replace all {PLACEHOLDERS}
vim sources/newsource/README.md
```

Replace placeholders like `{DISPLAY_NAME}`, `{SOURCE_ID}`, `{PREFIX}`, etc. with your actual values.

### Step 8: Run the Converter

Now populate the `apps/` directory by running the converter.

**Important**: The conversion workflow is currently manual. Automated source-based conversion is planned but not yet implemented.

For CasaOS sources, you would:
1. Clone the upstream repository
2. Run `generate-container-packages` on each app directory
3. Copy converted apps to your `sources/newsource/apps/` directory

See the existing `sources/casaos-official/apps/` directory structure as a reference for the expected output format.

**Note:** Automated sync workflows (planned) will handle this conversion automatically in the future.

### Step 9: Validate Structure

Validate your new source:

```bash
# Validate structure
./tools/validate-structure.sh runtipi

# Expected output:
# INFO: Validating source: runtipi
# INFO: ✓ Source runtipi validated successfully
# INFO: All validations passed successfully
```

If validation fails, review the error messages and fix the issues.

### Step 10: Test Build

Build packages to verify everything works:

```bash
# Build your source
./run build-source runtipi

# Check output
ls -lh build/

# Expected:
# runtipi-container-store_*.deb  (store package)
# runtipi-app1-container_*.deb   (app packages)
# runtipi-app2-container_*.deb
# ... (all converted apps)
```

## Configuration Details

### Package Naming Pattern

All packages follow this pattern:
```
{package_prefix}-{appname}-container
```

Examples:
- `casaos-uptimekuma-container`
- `runtipi-jellyfin-container`
- `custom-myapp-container`

The `package_prefix` is set in `upstream/source.yaml` and must match the `include_patterns` in `store/{source}.yaml`.

### Store ID Requirements

The store ID must:
- Match the source directory name exactly
- Use lowercase letters only
- Use hyphens (not underscores)
- Be unique across all sources

### Icon Requirements

Store icons should be:
- SVG format (preferred) or PNG
- 256x256 pixels minimum
- Clear and recognizable at small sizes
- Represent the upstream source brand (with permission)

### Workflow Path Filters

Each workflow only triggers on changes to:
- `sources/{your-source}/**` - Your source directory
- `tools/**` - Shared tooling
- `.github/actions/**` - Shared actions
- `.github/workflows/**{your-source}.yml` - Your workflows

This prevents unnecessary builds when other sources change.

## Testing Your Source

### Local Testing Checklist

- [ ] Structure validation passes
- [ ] Store package builds successfully
- [ ] App packages build successfully
- [ ] Package names follow convention
- [ ] Package metadata is correct
- [ ] Store definition is valid YAML

### Integration Testing

Test on a HaLOS system:

```bash
# 1. Build packages locally
./run build-source runtipi

# 2. Copy to test system
scp build/runtipi-container-store_*.deb pi@halos.local:/tmp/
scp build/runtipi-jellyfin-container_*.deb pi@halos.local:/tmp/

# 3. Install on test system
ssh pi@halos.local
sudo dpkg -i /tmp/runtipi-container-store_*.deb
sudo dpkg -i /tmp/runtipi-jellyfin-container_*.deb

# 4. Verify in Cockpit
# - Navigate to https://halos.local:9090
# - Go to Applications → Container Apps
# - Verify "Runtipi" store appears
# - Verify apps appear under the correct store
# - Test installing and running an app
```

### CI/CD Testing

Create a PR to test workflows:

```bash
# Create branch
git checkout -b feat/add-runtipi-source

# Stage all changes
git add sources/runtipi/
git add .github/workflows/*runtipi.yml

# Commit
git commit -m "feat(runtipi): add Runtipi source"

# Push
git push origin feat/add-runtipi-source

# Create PR
gh pr create --title "feat(runtipi): add Runtipi source" \
  --body "Adds Runtipi as a new container source"

# Watch CI checks
gh pr checks --watch
```

The PR workflow should:
1. Validate source structure ✓
2. Build all packages ✓
3. Comment on PR with results ✓

## Troubleshooting

### Validation Fails

**Problem:** `validate-structure.sh` reports errors

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check required directories exist
ls sources/runtipi/apps
ls sources/runtipi/store
ls sources/runtipi/upstream

# Check store YAML exists
ls sources/runtipi/store/*.yaml

# Check upstream config exists
ls sources/runtipi/upstream/source.yaml

# Validate YAML syntax
yq eval . sources/runtipi/store/runtipi.yaml
yq eval . sources/runtipi/upstream/source.yaml
```

### Build Fails

**Problem:** `build-source.sh` fails

**Common issues:**

1. **Missing debian/ directory:**
   ```bash
   # Ensure debian packaging exists
   ls -la sources/runtipi/store/debian/
   # Should contain: control, rules, changelog, copyright
   ```

2. **Invalid package prefix:**
   ```bash
   # Check prefix matches in both configs
   grep package_prefix sources/runtipi/upstream/source.yaml
   grep include_patterns sources/runtipi/store/runtipi.yaml
   # They must match: runtipi-*-container
   ```

3. **Missing converter:**
   ```bash
   # Verify converter exists in container-packaging-tools
   ./run shell
   generate-container-packages --help | grep runtipi
   ```

### Apps Don't Appear in Cockpit

**Problem:** Store installed but apps not visible

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Verify store package installed
dpkg -l | grep runtipi-container-store

# 2. Check store definition installed
ls /usr/share/container-stores/runtipi.yaml

# 3. Verify package filters correct
cat /usr/share/container-stores/runtipi.yaml | grep include_patterns

# 4. Restart Cockpit
sudo systemctl restart cockpit

# 5. Check Cockpit logs
journalctl -u cockpit -n 50
```

### Workflow Doesn't Trigger

**Problem:** PR created but CI checks don't run

**Solutions:**
```bash
# 1. Verify path filters in workflow
cat .github/workflows/pr-runtipi.yml | grep -A 5 paths:

# 2. Ensure PR modifies watched paths
# Workflow triggers on:
#   - sources/runtipi/**
#   - tools/**
#   - .github/workflows/**runtipi.yml

# 3. Force trigger by modifying watched path
touch sources/runtipi/README.md
git commit -am "chore: trigger CI"
git push
```

## Examples

### Reference Implementation: CasaOS Official

The only complete, working implementation currently in the repository:
- Source: `sources/casaos-official/`
- Workflows: `.github/workflows/*casaos-official.yml`
- Store: `sources/casaos-official/store/`
- Upstream config: `sources/casaos-official/upstream/source.yaml`

Use this as your template when adding new sources.

### Minimal Example Structure

```
sources/newsource/
├── apps/
│   ├── app1/
│   │   ├── metadata.yaml
│   │   ├── config.yml
│   │   └── docker-compose.yml
│   └── ... (more apps)
├── store/
│   ├── newsource.yaml
│   ├── icon.svg
│   └── debian/
│       ├── control
│       ├── rules
│       ├── changelog
│       └── copyright
├── upstream/
│   └── source.yaml
└── README.md
```

**See `sources/casaos-official/` for the actual working implementation.**

## Best Practices

1. **Start with casaos-official as reference:** Copy workflow patterns and structure
2. **Test locally first:** Validate and build before creating PR
3. **Use descriptive names:** Make source IDs and package prefixes clear
4. **Document categories:** Match categories to actual app types in your source
5. **Keep prefix short:** Package names will be `{prefix}-{app}-container`
6. **Version correctly:** Follow Debian changelog conventions
7. **Test integration:** Verify apps appear correctly in Cockpit UI

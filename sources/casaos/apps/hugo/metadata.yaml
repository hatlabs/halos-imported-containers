long_description: 'Hugo is a high-speed static site generation platform written in
  Go, optimized for speed and designed for flexibility. Advanced templating system
  and fast asset pipelines render a complete website in seconds, ideal for creating
  documentation sites, landing pages, and various project websites.


  Core features include optimized speed and a flexible framework. Concurrency in Go
  enables rapid rendering, supporting image processing (convert, resize, crop, rotate,
  adjust colors, apply filters, overlay text/images, extract EXIF data), JavaScript
  bundling (tree shaking, code splitting), Sass processing, and TailwindCSS support.
  Multilingual support and taxonomy system make it suitable for diverse sites like
  documentation, news, or events.


  It includes an embedded web server for real-time previews of content, structure,
  and style changes during development. Frequent releases ensure ongoing feature enhancements,
  keeping it cutting-edge. With efficiency and flexibility at the core, the platform
  delivers a modern static site generation solution.

long_description: 'Open WebUI is a feature-rich, user-friendly self-hosted AI platform
  designed for fully offline operation, supporting multiple large language model runners
  and API integration. Its intuitive Web interface provides powerful AI deployment
  capabilities, ideal for developers, researchers, and AI enthusiasts building localized
  intelligent applications.


  The tool''s core features include local model execution and Retrieval Augmented
  Generation (RAG). It supports Ollama and OpenAI-compatible APIs (e.g., LMStudio,
  GroqCloud), enabling seamless model switching and multi-model conversations. RAG
  enhances chat experiences through local document loading or web search integration
  (e.g., SearXNG, Google PSE). Granular permissions and role-based access control
  (RBAC) ensure security with customized user role management.


  It supports Markdown and LaTeX for enriched interactions and offers hands-free voice
  and video call features for dynamic communication. Image generation integration
  (e.g., DALL-E, ComfyUI) enriches visual content, and a model builder enables creating
  and importing custom models via the interface. The Pipelines plugin framework supports
  Python plugins, extending functionality like function calling and real-time translation.
  The tool’s offline privacy and flexibility deliver a modern AI interaction solution.


  **Key Features:**

  - Local execution of Ollama and OpenAI-compatible APIs with multi-model conversations

  - RAG support with local document and web search integration (e.g., SearXNG, Google

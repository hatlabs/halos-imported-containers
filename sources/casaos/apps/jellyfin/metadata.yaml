long_description: 'Jellyfin stands out among media server applications for its fully
  open-source, free, and privacy-focused design. Unlike Emby and Plex, Jellyfin delivers
  robust media management, real-time transcoding, and granular multi-user permissions
  without subscription costs, operating independently of cloud services to ensure
  full user control over data. Its community-driven development and efficient resource
  usage enable smooth performance on low-end devices, making it the go-to choice for
  privacy-conscious and budget-savvy users.


  Picture your movies, TV shows, and music at your fingertips, accessible on any device.
  Jellyfin transforms your media collection into a personalized entertainment hub,
  surpassing traditional photo albums with a seamless browsing and playback experience.

  Jellyfin offers high-quality streaming, automatic metadata fetching, and personalized
  recommendations, all at no cost. It supports multiple users, each with their own
  media library, catering to the diverse needs of families or teams.

  Deploying Jellyfin on private cloud devices like Zima provides near-unlimited storage,
  smooth streaming, and secure multi-device access. For NAS enthusiasts or anyone
  looking to elevate their home media setup, Jellyfin is the perfect solution.

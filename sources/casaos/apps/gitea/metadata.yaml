long_description: "Gitea is a painless self-hosted all-in-one software development\
  \ service, it includes Git hosting, code review, team collaboration, package registry\
  \ and CI/CD. It is similar to GitHub, Bitbucket and GitLab. \n\n- Code Hosting\n\
  Gitea supports creating and managing repositories, browsing commit history and code\
  \ files, reviewing and merging code submissions, managing collaborators, handling\
  \ branches, and more. It also supports many common Git features such as tags, Cherry-pick,\
  \ hooks, integrated collaboration tools, and more.\n\n- Lightweight and Fast\nOne\
  \ of Gitea's design goals is to be lightweight and fast in response. Unlike some\
  \ large code hosting platforms, it remains lean, performing well in terms of speed,\
  \ and is suitable for resource-limited server environments. Due to its lightweight\
  \ design, Gitea has relatively low resource consumption and performs well in resource-constrained\
  \ environments.\n\n- Easy Deployment and Maintenance\nIt can be easily deployed\
  \ on various servers without complex configurations or dependencies. This makes\
  \ it convenient for individual developers or small teams to set up and manage their\
  \ own Git services.\n\n- Security\nGitea places a strong emphasis on security, offering\
  \ features such as user permission management, access control lists, and more to\
  \ ensure the security of code and data.\n\n- Code Review\nCode review supports both\
  \ the Pull Request workflow and AGit workflow. Reviewers can browse code online\
  \ and provide review comments or feedback. Submitters can receive review comments\
  \ and respond or modify code online. Code reviews can help individuals and organizations\
  \ enhance code quality.\n\n- CI/CD\nGitea Actions supports CI/CD functionality,\
  \ compatible with GitHub Actions. Users can write workflows in familiar YAML format\
  \ and reuse a variety of existing Actions plugins. Actions plugins support downloading\
  \ from any Git website.\n\n- Project Management\nGitea tracks project requirements,\
  \ features, and bugs through columns and issues. Issues support features like branches,\
  \ tags, milestones, assignments, time tracking, due dates, dependencies, and more.\n\
  \n- Artifact Repository\nGitea supports over 20 different types of public or private\
  \ software package management, including Cargo, Chef, Composer, Conan, Conda, Container,\
  \ Helm, Maven, npm, NuGet, Pub, PyPI, RubyGems, Vagrant, and more.\n\n- Open Source\
  \ Community Support\nGitea is an open-source project based on the MIT license. It\
  \ has an active open-source community that continuously develops and improves the\
  \ platform. The project also actively welcomes community contributions, ensuring\
  \ updates and innovation.\n\n- Multilingual Support\nGitea provides interfaces in\
  \ multiple languages, catering to users globally and promoting internationalization\
  \ and localization.\n"

Its responsive Web interface allows users to access content effortlessly via any browser, with fullscreen reading and full localization support, ideal for comic and e-book enthusiasts building personalized digital libraries.


  The app''s core features include robust library management and an enhanced reading experience. Users can organize content with collections, reading lists, and custom tags, editing metadata to keep libraries neatly arranged. The built-in manga reader supports dual-page mode, Webtoon scrolling, and image splitting, while the e-book reader offers customizable fonts, spacing, and themes, with by-line progress syncing across devices. The PDF reader provides light/dark modes and diverse settings.

Bulk imports and full-text search streamline large collection management.


  It can be flexibly deployed on personal servers or NAS devices, with an active community providing extensive documentation to enhance functionality.

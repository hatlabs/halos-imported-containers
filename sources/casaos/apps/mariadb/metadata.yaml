long_description: 'MariaDB Server is one of the most popular database servers in the
  world. It''s made by the original developers of MySQL and guaranteed to stay open
  source.


  MariaDB Server is one of the most popular open source relational databases. It’s
  made by the original developers of MySQL and guaranteed to stay open source. It
  is part of most cloud offerings and the default in most Linux distributions.


  It is built upon the values of performance, stability, and openness, and MariaDB
  Foundation ensures contributions will be accepted on technical merit. Recent new
  functionality includes advanced clustering with Galera Cluster 4, compatibility
  features with Oracle Database and Temporal Data Tables, allowing one to query the
  data as it stood at any point in the past.

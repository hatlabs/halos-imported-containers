# This directory will contain converted application definitions
#
# Each app gets its own subdirectory with:
# - metadata.yaml: Package metadata (name, description, version, license)
# - config.yml: User-configurable parameters (env vars, volumes, ports)
# - docker-compose.yml: Container service definition
# - debian/: Debian packaging files (generated by container-packaging-tools)
#
# Apps are populated by:
# 1. Running the converter from container-packaging-tools
# 2. Automated sync workflow (future feature)
# 3. Manual conversion for testing
#
# This .gitkeep file ensures the apps/ directory is tracked by git
# even when empty. Remove it once you have apps in this directory.

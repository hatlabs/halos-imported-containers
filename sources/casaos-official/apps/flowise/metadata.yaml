long_description: 'An open source generative AI development platform for building
  AI Agents and LLM workflows


  Flowise is a generative AI development platform for building AI agents and LLM workflows.
  An intuitive interface with a visual editor simplifies complex workflow design,
  ideal for developers creating diverse AI applications, from chatbots to data processing
  pipelines.


  Core features include visual orchestration and data integration. Support for various
  models, custom code, and branching, looping, and routing logic enables complex workflow
  creation. Connection to over 100 data sources, vector databases, and memory modules
  ensures flexible data ingestion. Monitoring capabilities provide execution logs
  and visual debugging for workflow transparency and maintenance. Self-hosted and
  air-gapped deployment options accommodate diverse infrastructure needs.


  It offers data processing with transforms, filters, aggregates, and RAG indexing
  pipelines. Memory optimization and planning techniques enhance performance, while
  MCP integration supports tool connections and authentication. Security controls
  include role-based access, single sign-on, and encrypted credentials for data protection.
  API, JavaScript and Python SDKs, and command-line interface enable extensibility,
  with embedded chat components and a template marketplace accelerating development.
  Scalability supports high-throughput workflows, and evaluation features optimize
  performance. With flexibility and efficiency at the core, the platform delivers
  a modern solution for AI development.

long_description: 'Node-RED is a flow-based low-code development platform that enables
  creating automation tasks and applications by connecting various nodes. A browser-based
  editor, simple to use, makes it ideal for users in home automation, industrial control,
  or other fields to quickly build data processing flows.


  Core features include a low-code flow editor and robust data handling. Built on
  Node.js with an event-driven, non-blocking model, the platform supports real-time
  data collection, transformation, and visualization. A palette with over 5000 nodes
  allows users to construct flows via drag-and-drop. A rich text editor enables creating
  JavaScript functions for enhanced customization.


  It stores flows in JSON format, facilitating easy import and export for sharing.
  A built-in library allows saving useful functions, templates, or flows for reuse,
  and an online flow library supports sharing top flows globally. With ease of use
  and efficiency at the core, the platform delivers a modern solution for diverse
  automation needs.

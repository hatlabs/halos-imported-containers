long_description: 'The Unifi-controller software is a powerful, enterprise wireless
  software engine ideal for high-density client deployments requiring low latency
  and high uptime performance.


  For Unifi to adopt other devices, e.g. an Access Point, it is required to change
  the inform IP address. Because Unifi runs inside Docker by default it uses an IP
  address not accessible by other devices. To change this go to Settings > System
  Settings > Controller Configuration and set the Controller Hostname/IP to a hostname
  or IP address accessible by your devices. Additionally the checkbox "Override inform
  host with controller hostname/IP" has to be checked, so that devices can connect
  to the controller during adoption (devices use the inform-endpoint during adoption).'

long_description: 'PostgreSQL is an advanced, enterprise-class, and open-source relational
  database system. PostgreSQL supports both SQL (relational) and JSON (non-relational)
  querying.


  PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system with over
  35 years of active development that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability,
  feature robustness, and performance.


  PostgreSQL is a highly stable database backed by more than 20 years of development
  by the open-source community.


  PostgreSQL is used as a primary database for many web applications as well as mobile
  and analytics applications.

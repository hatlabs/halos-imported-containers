long_description: SABnzbd is an Open Source Binary Newsreader written in Python. It's
  totally free, easy to use, and works practically everywhere. SABnzbd makes Usenet
  as simple and streamlined as possible by automating everything we can. All you have
  to do is add an .nzb. SABnzbd takes over from there, where it will be automatically
  downloaded, verified, repaired, extracted and filed away with zero human interaction.
  SABnzbd offers an easy setup wizard and has self-analysis tools to verify your setup.

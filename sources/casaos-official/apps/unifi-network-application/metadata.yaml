long_description: 'The Unifi network application software is a powerful, enterprise
  wireless software engine ideal for high-density client deployments requiring low
  latency and high uptime performance.


  Only mandatory ports are enabled by default, to extend functionality consider exposing
  1900:1900/udp, 8843:8843, 8880:8880, 6789:6789, 5514:5514/udp.

  Other ports specifications [here](https://docs.linuxserver.io/images/docker-unifi-network-application/#ports-p).


  Because the network application runs inside Docker by default it uses an IP address
  not accessible by other devices.

  So, for it to adopt other devices, it is required to use port `8080` and change
  the inform IP address. To do so, go in settings and search for the `Inform Host`
  option, there select override and set the address to that of the host.

  Often, it is also needed to ssh into the devices you want to adopt and manually
  set the inform IP address, the command needed for doing so is `set-inform http://HOST-ADDRESS:8080/inform`.

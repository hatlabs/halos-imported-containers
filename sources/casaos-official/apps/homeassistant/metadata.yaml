  to an open garage door. The Assist voice assistant enables natural language control,
  compatible with phones, tablets, smartwatches, and even traditional telephones,
  allowing users to customize interactions and experiment with AI conversations to
  meet diverse needs.

  NodeRed for third-party automations, or turning devices into Spotify Connect targets.
  Home energy management optimizes solar production and usage planning to save costs.
